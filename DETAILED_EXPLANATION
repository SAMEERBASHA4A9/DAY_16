In the above code a executes at 10 ns and after 10ns b starts executiona but there is delay of 10ns(intra assignment delay) so b is updated at 30ns and now the actual picture starts
after that we have non blocking statement #10 b=#10 3'b001;
                                              #10 c<=#10 3'b010;
                                              #10 d<=#10 3'b011; after execution of b 10 ns inter assignment delay is executed then only c starts excutes due to the quality of inter assignment delay,
                                              but while executing intra assignment delay with non blocking along with c 10ns intra assignment delay is executed parallely so c is updated at 50 and d is updated at 60 but
                                              #10 d<=#10 3'b011;
                                              #10 e=#10 3'b100; the intra assignment delay of d and inter assignment delay works parllely and e is updated at 70 ns
                                              finally remember that in both blocking and non blocking inter assignment dealy blocks the statement until the delay gets completed.

reg [2:0] a,b,c,d,e;

initial
begin
a=#10 3'b000;
#10 
b=#10 3'b001;
#10 
c<=#10 3'b010;// after completing 36 th line both intra and inter assignment delay works parllely because in nonblocking statements works prallely so d starts execution at 60 but 38 th line delay stops execution because the iner assignment delay stops exection until the delay completes
#10 
d<=#10 3'b011;// 39 th line intra assignment and inter assignment delay at 40 works parllely because we have non bocling assignment at line 39 and after line 40 e starts evaluting
#10
e=#10 3'b100;
end

NOTE: 
1 inter assignemt delay works as blocking assignment it does not allow the below line until it completes the delay weather the below is blocking or non blocking assignment.
2. in non blocking intra and inter assignment delays work parllely as (c<=#10 3'b010;
                                                                        #10 ) this one works.
